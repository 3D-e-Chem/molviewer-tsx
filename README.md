# Installation

```
npm install
```

# Development setup

The api/ directory contains an example dataset which can be used during development and testing.
In production the /api url is server by an application server.

1. Start web server on port 2015 to host api/ directory.
```
caddy
```

2. Start development web server

```
npm start
```

Browser should open on http://localhost:3000

# Editing

Use Visual Studio Code v1.5 or later.
When editing *.tsx files use Typescript inside the repo and not the Typescript shipped with VSCode.

# Unit test

```
npm test
```

To also get coverage run
```
npm test -- --coverage
```
The coverage reports will be written to `coverage/remapped` directory.

# Linting

```
npm run lint
```

Enable tslinting inside Visual Studio Code with

1. Open the command palette CRTL + P
2. Run `ext install tslint`

# Deploy

First build with:
```
npm run build
```

Then copy essential build files to deployment target:
```
./deploy.sh <target>/
```
